## ‚ö° One-Page Summary of Prototype

This prototype is a app-based solution designed to enhance the experience and safety of pilgrims during the Mahakumbh event. It helps visitors navigate the vast event area by showing key routes and important locations such as ghats, medical centers, police help desks, and event schedules. The system also integrates a unique innovation: QR-coded wristbands assigned to every participant. In case a person goes missing, authorized personnel can scan their QR wristband using the platform, immediately fetching their profile and notifying the family with the person‚Äôs last known location.

## üéØ Core Problem Addressed

Managing crowd navigation and ensuring quick reunification of missing persons during the large-scale Mahakumbh event is a significant challenge. Traditional methods are manual and slow, creating safety risks. This system provides an efficient, real-time solution by combining event mapping and automated QR wristband tracking.

## üöÄ Clear Overview of Prototype/Idea

The Mahakumbh Event Navigation & Missing Person Alert System is a web-based platform designed to improve safety and navigation during the Mahakumbh event. It provides an interactive map that displays important locations such as ghats, medical centers, police help desks, and event schedules to help visitors easily navigate the event grounds.

The key innovation is the integration of QR-coded wristbands provided to every visitor. If a person is found missing, authorized personnel can scan their wristband using the web platform‚Äôs QR scanner. The system instantly retrieves the person‚Äôs profile and captures their current location using the browser‚Äôs geolocation feature. A notification is simulated (or sent in real implementation) to the family with the person‚Äôs last known position, allowing for fast and efficient reunification.

An admin dashboard provides a real-time log of scanned persons and their locations, enabling event authorities to monitor and respond to missing person cases effectively. The solution is designed to be simple, scalable, and deployable using React.js, normal CSS, Leaflet for maps, and Firebase for the database, making it ideal for large-scale event applications.
